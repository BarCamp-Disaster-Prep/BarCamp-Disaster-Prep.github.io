This blog is to help make Disaster Preparation accessible to anyone who may not believe they have the time, money, or motivation to assemble a disaster "Go Bag" or a "Hunker Down Stash". We give you tips and tricks to make preparing for hazardous situations easy and non-stressful.

This blog was created during BarCamp9 Build Day!
