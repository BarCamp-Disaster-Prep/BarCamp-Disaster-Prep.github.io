Hunker in the Bunker 



There are a few occasions when you might need to “shelter in place” or “hunker down” (the news people LOVE this one). If this happens there are more thing to keep on hand to make your time without power, water, internet, or any modern conveniences you hold dear more bearable.

**Hunker Down Tub** - For when your power goes out and you need to camp at your house for a few days…

Utensils - keep the plastic ones from takeout
Manual can opener
Non perishable food…you actually like to eat - Buy an extra of things you like on any shopping trip and toss it in your prep box.
Seasonings - salt, pepper, hot sauce, tarragon…whatever
Water - A big jug might be best over a case of bottles, but make sure there’s enough for everyone

Buy right before you leave/hunker - 

Bread
A flask…with some booze. 
Be aware that you may need to eat everything in your freezer over the next few days. 
CLEAN OUT YOUR FRIDGE. Use it or lose it! A few days without power and that gets NASTY really quickly. [See..](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katrina_refrigerator)
