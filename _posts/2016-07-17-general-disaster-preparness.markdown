NOTE: Watching Doomsday Preppers does not make you more prepared for a disaster and does not count as prepping. A small amount of effort is required. 

We get it, you have a lot going on (or you’re just really lazy) and getting a little something together in case of a disaster is not on the top of your list. But think, wouldn’t you rather have something other than the lint in your pocket come a hurricane, earthquake, or when the loan shark is on your tail? 



Here are a few options of what to do, ranging from most lazy to slightly less lazy. 

**Make a Go Bag (AKA Bug Out Bag)** - for when you need to get the hell outta Dodge…fast.

**LAZIEST VERSION**: Take those old pants, a shirt, and some shoes that you don’t really wear anymore (any maybe some underpants and socks), put them in that bag you don’t really use anymore. BOOM, you’ve got yourself a go bag. If you’re feeling wacky, toss in a few shirts and pants for a potential extended stay. 

In conclusion, get an old bag or backpack, insert following:

* Shirts - You have a ton you’ve gotten for free at a conference, etc. you know you do
* Pants - The ones with a hole or are out of style but you can’t bear to part with
* Undies…you’ll be happy you have this
* Socks
Old tennis shoes

**EXTRA**: You’ll be happy to have these, but if you can’t exert a little effort, these are things you *could* pick up once you are out of Dodge. 

Some cash (like $40 in small bills)
Travel size toiletries 
Toilet Paper
First aid kit
Flashlight
Multi-purpose tool/pocket knife


**UPGRADES**: There might be other things you need when you head out in a hurry. Think about ways to charge your phone, see in the dark, or maybe some entertainment. 

- Coloring book and crayons

- A book you love 

- Batteries

- Solar or battery powered charger 

- Weather radio

- Ponchos
