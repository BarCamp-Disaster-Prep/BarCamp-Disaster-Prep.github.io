Building up a 3 or 7 day supply of food and water can be daunting and expensive,
but it doesn't have to be either if you just give yourself a little bit of time
to plan ahead. 

Hurricane season, for instance, officially starts on June 1, however the season 
doesn't start to reach peak until September.  Even if you're one of those lazy, 
late starters, you can still begin to slowly accumulate the appropriate items and 
probably be okay for the season.  Keep in mind, however, that a hurricane can 
come at any time - even months "early - so you should definitely begin thinking 
about your slow accumulation earlier in the Spring.

A good disaster food stash is going to contain nonperishable foods, but more 
importantly it will contain stuff you will actually eat and not get sick of by 
hunker-down meal #3.  Unless you really like tunafish, don't buy twenty cans of 
"Charlie Tuna".  If you do really like tunafish, remember to grab some smallish 
containers of mayo, salt, mustard...  anything you will need to actually turn 
that can of tuna into something actually palatable.

So, how can you build up your stash without breaking this week's grocery budget?  
Slowly and stresslessly!  Do you go shopping every week?  Each time you shop, 
just grab one or two extras of the nonperishable items you are buying for your 
kitchen pantry.  Why?  Because you know you will eat it in a disaster if you 
are already planning to eat it on a normal Tuesday!  More importantly, you will
be able to cycle these items into your pantry at the end of hurricane season and
they will not go to waste.  There's nothing worse than adding 20 cans of tuna to
your pantry on November 30 that are still there next Spring.

<b>Week 1:  </b>
I'm on a PB&J kick, so I buy extra jars of jif and jam.  When I get home,
I add them to my Stash.

<b>Week 2:  </b>
My warehouse store had cans of chicken on sale, so I put half of them in 
my stash.  I also asked my water delivery guy to leave me an extra 5-gallon bottle,
and I put it in my stash, too!

<b>Week 3:  </b>
My grocer is having a sale on pouches of "heat and eat" rice, so I grab 
a few and put them in my stash.

<b>Week 4: </b>
I pick up a box of protein bars and... put them in my stash!

If all this was slowly and stresslessly done in May, then on June 1 I can take a 
"start of season" look in my stash, and make a list.  Yeah, I'll eat all that, 
but I am going to need a can opener, mayo, salt, soy sauce, and utensils.  I'll 
just add that list to my phone and grab these things during my June shopping trips!

It's rudimentary and imperfect, but I didn't have to stress about following a list
and building a huge stock of "suggested foods" that I will actually not enjoy
eating if I actually had to.  Even better, this will probably feed me for three 
days (remember - prepare for a 72 hour minimum), and the only thing I will need 
to pick up during the mad-rush stock runs is a loaf of bread for my sammies.  
In and out - easy peasy!  Better yet, this level of preparation took very little
effort out of my day-to-day, but I am far better off than if I didn't consider
taking any steps at all, and I only spent a few extra bucks at each shopping trip.
